# betterlockscreen
*A simple lock script for i3lock*

Most of i3lock script out there converts your defined image to add blur, glitch or dim effect to image and it feels so slow and btw who needs dynamic lock background,
its not like I change lockscreen background every 5 minutes.
I wanted something that was fast and still should have all the effects I want for lockscreen background.

This script generates or already caches the variant for your custom images before hand so they can be later used any number of time as lockscreen background,
without the need to apply same effect again and again

### Debian based users

UtkarshVerma was so kind to provide an installation script for debian based systems, [check it out here.](https://github.com/UtkarshVerma/installer-scripts/blob/master/betterlockscreen.sh)

---

To set desktop background on startup, add following lines to your .xintrc after pushing script to your path or you can use absolute path to script too

```
exec betterlockscreen -w
```

If you are i3wm user, add following line to your i3config (~/.config/i3/config or ~/.i3/config)

*custom shortcut to lockscreen*
```
# custom keybinding to lockscreen, use --lock dim or --lock blur below for different backgrounds
bindsym $mod+shift+x exec betterlockscreen --lock
```

*set last cached image as desktop background*
```
# Set last used image as desktop background
exec --no-startup-id betterlockscreen -w
```

*set the image cache to a random image from a directory of your choice on each startup*
```
# where Pictures/Wallpapers is the directory you would want to get random wallpapers from
exec --no-startup-id betterlockscreen -u ~/Pictures/Wallpapers

# add this only if you want to use same random image as desktop background too
# it might not work as it takes few seconds for images to be cached,
# try adding delay of 5 seconds if thats the case
exec --no-startup-id betterlockscreen -w
```
